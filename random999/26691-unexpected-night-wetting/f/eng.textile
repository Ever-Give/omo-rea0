Late last night, after two holds and while reading the forums, I decided to just go to bed, and as I got up out of bed, I felt a small urge to pee- not a large one, though. But since I had the chance I thought I might as well. I walked out of my room, and that's when I started peeing. I wasn't desperate at all, and it wasn't a forceful pee, it came out quite steadily, but whatever I did I couldn't stop it, so I ran to the toilet while still holding myself with now my now pretty wet hands and did the rest in the toilet. It turned out that there was quite a lot of wee in my bladder, and the fact that there were no warnings before I starting wetting myself was because my bladder was already weakened from earlier that day.

I still find it weird that I started wetting myself with such a slow stream, and yet it wasn't spurting everywhere and neither could I stop it, which sort of goes against every wetting I've had previously, and I thought it was a very interesting experience to have.
