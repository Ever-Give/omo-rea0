Can't stop wetting

I finally wet for the first time the other night while everyone was asleep. I actually wanted to fool around with my boyfriend with my full bladder but he had work super early and wasn't in the mood, so I sat and sulked for a bit because I was so bored. By 2 a.m. I had a pretty full bladder so I went to the bathroom, stood in the shower, and hiked up my panties. At first it was difficult to let go because I've never done it before and I had to convince myself it was okay pee in my panties. But once I started dripping I couldn't stop...and it felt so damn good. I've been wanting to do a wetting for the longest time, but never found the courage. Now I like to wet myself before every shower for easier clean up. I haven't told my boyfriend about it yet, but I'm thinking about having an "accident" in front of him to see how he reacts. I don't think I'll try any public holds or wettings, but I love my dirty little secret.
