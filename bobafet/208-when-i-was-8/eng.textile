Once, when I was 8, I woke up in the middle of the night with a really bad need to pee

I was really tired and didn't realise immediadtly that it was so urgent, so I held it with both hands trying to sleep aigain

Then, after 5 - 10 min, My brain was suddenly completly awake and I tell to myself "I can't wait till the morning I have to go too bad"

So I stand up and started to walk to go bathroom (at this time I was absolutly sure that I can made it to the bathroom) Then, 1sec after power on the light I heard a strange noise under me, I freeze and look "from where come the noise" thand I understand... It was a dripping noise... I was wetting myself (without feeling release on my poor extra full bladder) I managed to stop the flow and after 1 more second I just think "I dont care, I am allready wet" then I open the floodgates...

Probably because of the size of my house at this time (old farm, If I had to go, I had to pass trough my bedroom, a hall, 2 medium size steps, another hall, a large room we called "rear kitchen", a kitchen, a veranda, another hall, the garage (yes, the toilet was in the end of the garage)

Wow, I feel lucky.

For me, I have to take 3-4 steps from my computer to my door, and then 2-3 steps to the bathroom right in front of my face.

It is literally less than 30 feet away from me

Now it's the same for me... but it was the only time the distance between my bedroom and the toilet made me "have an accident"...I had others, but in differant circumstances
