I went for a short walk today I didn't need to pee but I drank some water so I knew there was liquid in me. So as I walked around I was pressing on my bladder. I was wearing a yellow t-shirt, blue jeans and blue briefs. After a bit of pressing I felt a dribble, the dribbles became spurts, more and more I could feel my briefs getting warmer and warmer, until the leaks because an explosion of hot golden pee sloshed around in my underwear warming me up then surged down my jeans and legs.
