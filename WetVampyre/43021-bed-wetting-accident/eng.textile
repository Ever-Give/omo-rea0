So yesterday night, my partner and i decided to watch a movie. Since i have a small bladder and i hate having to interupt the movie, i putted a goodnite style diaper when i got upstairs to pee before the movie. At least, i knew i would have protection in case i wouldn't be able to hold through the entire thing.

Surprisingly, i didn't need to use it while we watched the movie. I was super proud of myself for not having an accident and i got praised too. It was very late and my partner and i went to bed. I was so tired almost instantly fell asleep, forgetting about doing my "before bed" routine. Not doing this routine usually end up with a wet diaper or a wet bed.

I woke up this morning and my diaper was completely saturated. I assume i was so tired that i didn't even woke up ( wich i usually don't when i wear protection for some reason). Then, i recalled i forgot to use the bathroom before bed... I was actually surprised since i peed so much and i was just wearing a goodnite style diaper. I am very impressed by how much this diaper can hold and that it didn't even leak. Now, i am shamefully sitting in the bed, writting this, waiting for my partner to discover my wet self and give me appropriate punishment...
