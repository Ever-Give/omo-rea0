I'm a 22/M.

Currently, there's a heatwave in most parts of western Europe, allowing me to wear swimming shorts all day, without anyone giving a damn.

I usually don't wet myself that often because I'm either with my parents, or with my girlfriend (who doesn't know I'm into wetting), however, as I'm wearing swimming shorts all day and since I'm going in the pool about 5-6 times a day in those temperatures, my shorts are always wet. Yesterday, I really had to piss, but, since I was wearing wet shorts, I thought to myself no one would actually notice if I just pissed myself right there. So, obviously, I just let it all go, and no one noticed, no one cared while I was just pissing myself.

Following that amazing moment, I've just kept wetting myself whenever I had to pee. I've wet myself 4 times already today and counting.

I'm actually letting go as I'm writing this post..
