I volunteer at a zoo and witnessed some desperation a while back. There's not much to tell but I thought I'd share it anyway.

In our area there aren't that many zoos close together, so many people have to travel a fair way to visit. I was on my lunch break and decided to buy a book from the gift shop/admissions. There were three people already in line and only one person on the checkout. I took my book to the back of the line which now included two more people.

I wasn't paying much attention at first until I noticed the woman in front of me move from side to side. She stomped her feet vigorously and bobbed up and down. I realised that she must have travelled a long way and is desperate to pee! By the looks of her she would have an accident before they even bought their tickets!

Sadly, one of the staff members saw me and called out 'if you want to come round I'll take payment for that' referring to me and my book. I wondered briefly if the woman in front thought that she was being called and if the disappointment had an effect on her bladder... I felt terrible for jumping the line though!

Sadly I couldn't exactly hang around after that as I had to go and get some food, but I wonder if she made it or not as the nearest toilets are a few minutes walk from the entrance...
