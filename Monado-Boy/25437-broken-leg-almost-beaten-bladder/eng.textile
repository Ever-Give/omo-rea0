I broke my leg about eighteen months ago and while I was stuck in my room I spent most of my time playing video games. Lucky I wasn't alone because my best friend would visit nearly every day to keep me company (but I suspect it was mostly to use my xbox)

One day we're both there and I have to pee. My leg is still in a cast at this point and for some reason my bladder control was worse than usual. I would of hopped to the bathroom, it being just outside of my bedroom door, but said room was currently occupied by my baby brother being bathed.

Now, picture the scene, I'm there, sat on my bed, waiting for the bathroom door to open, trying not to show any signs because of my friend and I'm trying not to focus on anything but my games (and I kid you not I was playing the water temple of zelda.....seriously). After an eternity the door opens and after waiting another minute for my baby brother to finally get out of the bath I get up, hop over to the toilet,closed the door and let go of a waterfall of pure agony

I then took my pain and used it to ace the water temple (Irony + pain makes a dangerous combination)

That's the closest I've ever come to wetting myself and I'm glad it didn't happen in front of my friend, the jokes would never end
