Yesterday a Spanish television channel was broadcasting live the eruption of a volcano on a Canary Island.

The broadcast was quite long, they had already taken more than three hours ... And at one point the presenter started to enthusiastically talk about the lava stream from the volcano in a way that could be really sadistic to someone with a full bladder.

"You can see one, two, three.. six jets of lava flowing down the hillside waiting to be washed off" At that moment one reporter interrupted her and urgently said:

"Voy a mear"= "I'm going to take a piss"

After that all went silent for a while. It was a pretty hilarious moment.

Maybe she was already bursting after all the time standing there for the broadcast and the mention of the streams and the recreation of the presenter was too much for her!
