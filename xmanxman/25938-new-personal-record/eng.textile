I just measured and held 950 ml all by myself :) I've always wanted to hit a liter, and I'm very close! The trick was to practice emptying my bladder when I'm full. Previously, I've pretty much been unable to empty everything out when I'm really, really desperate because I feel as though the state is foreign; my sphincter muscle can't really relax enough and I end up only emptying maybe 80%. This usually results in a disappointing 850 to 900 ml, which is good but not quite there. Over the past few weeks though, I've been getting myself to just before the involuntary release point (right before I start having glorious, wonderful bladder spasms :DDD) and peeing completely.

I'm going to make one liter. I'm going to be able to look at any liter bottle one day and think, yep, I can fit that amount of liquid inside of me, no problem.

As they say, practice makes perfect! God I love this little sport :)
