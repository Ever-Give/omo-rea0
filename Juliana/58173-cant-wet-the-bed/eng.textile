HI, I'm a twentysomething female and can't seem to wet the bed on purpose.

Is it for anyone else also difficult to untrain yourself? And which are the tips and tricks I can try? I go to bed with a full bladder and wake up in the middle of the night really desperate but can't let go. I have to stand up straight or sit on the edge of the bed for it to work. It's really frustrating....

Hmmm that's interesting. Do you have trouble wetting yourself anywhere else?

No, I can wet my pants wherever I want during the day. Mostly standing, sometimes sitting down.

Looking to achieve a sleep wetting in the first place en and if I like it getting over the mental block eventually. So I don't wake anymore when desperate.

Hold consecutively a few times during the day and use a bathroom when you're really desperate already, so your bladder muscles get tired and you shouldn't have so much trouble losing control during sleep or pee on purpose while lying in bed, because you will get a strong urge to pee after a few consecutive holding attempts.

Thanks, will try this

Thanks for the advice. I will try wetting while lying down. My bladder is already weakened, did a lot of holding last week.
