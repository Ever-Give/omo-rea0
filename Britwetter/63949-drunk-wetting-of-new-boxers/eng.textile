So as there’s a second lockdown in Britain, there’s not much to do at the moment except to get drunk with friends.

So last night me and 2 others that I live with decided to get drunk. As anyone who has ever drank heavily before knows, once you break the seal you don’t stop peeing. As for me, I normally break the seal after only 2 drinks so my bladder fills up quite quickly.

After everyone went to bed around 2am I went up to my room and played on my pc a bit. I drank a lot of water to try and sober up a little so I didn’t get a hangover the next morning (it didn’t work.) After 15 minutes I noticed my bladder filling up and as time went on it got worse to the point where I was leaking and spurting. At this point I grabbed my towel, put it on the floor, pulled down my grey joggers and flooded my red boxers.
