Hi there! I’m new but I wanted to share a story of an experience I had at the store the other day. So I have trouble controlling my bladder when I sneeze and it tends to cause problems for me. I also get lazy and will occasionally go to the gas station for snacks in my pyjamas late at night. I should also note when I wear my PJs I don’t wear underwear. So I was standing in the chip isle and I sort of had to pee but not too terribly so I didn’t think much of it. Suddenly I had to sneeze but it came on so fast I didn’t have time to cross my legs like I usually do when I feel a sneeze coming. The sneeze came out so fast I leaked a stream of pee. Because I didn’t have underwear on, it slowly rolled all the way down my leg under my baggy pyjamas and into my shoe. I realized it hadn’t left any stain on my pants so I calmly paid for my stuff and left with my leg and show still wet. I’m so glad it didn’t show on my pants!
