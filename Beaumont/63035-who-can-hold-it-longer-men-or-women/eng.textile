Women might have weaker bladders and less Bathroom opportunities , and therefore have more experience holding it. I remember watching an online show where Japanese men and women competed in holding contests. The male teams were always losing, leaving many of the women dry as the winners.

I think that we can keep a bursting bladder for more time, cause on the rare occasions that I could notice, males tends to suffer pain quicker than woman when trying to hold it for the longest time (idk why)

The penis is very sensitive and doesn’t like discomfort. One way to relieve the stress is to hold it.
