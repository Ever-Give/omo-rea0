New to the account side. Hi there. Used this site soo many time for...yeah....

Anyways my first give back is a wetting that just happened.

I held my bladder for as long as possible all while playing games, drinking many different things including alchohol. I started to feel the streams of pee escaping into my underwear. I cross my legs and hold longer.

JUST HOLD UNTIL AFTER THIS MATCH! Well, that is what I told myself, at least. I got in battle and started losing control, for real. I didn't want to wet my chair but....

Anywho, so there I was, in a ranked match, slowly peeing my shorts no matter what I did. I stayed another 10 minutes, leaking the whole time. Got 2nd place, what can I say?

I immediately turned off everything, went outside and drank and peed to my hearts desire

The night isn't over, should I do a round 2? I haven't had to pee since. I may be around 35% full.
