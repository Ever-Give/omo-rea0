Hello h, Do you have any nocturnal enuresis experiences to tell? do you do it by accident or laziness.

Of course I had many accidents during my childhood, and suffered the surge of hatred of my parents. But it still happens to me ... sometimes for exemple during this Santa holidays December 25th I can't control my bladder at night so I wet my bed . The doctor said it was partly caused by anxiety and trauma. But I must admit that regressing is sort of good for me. For example wearing protections (drynites) (something I don't do every day) I feel safe and allow me to sleep more peacefully.
