This is the first time I'm actually posting an experience, so any feedback would be appreciated.

I'm six foot with broad shoulders and a large bladder capacity.

I had felt my bladder filling, but I remained in my chair and enjoyed the feelings. I let myself spurt a bit before I grinned and went to my bathroom. I then stood up, made sure I had things ready for cleaning up the puddle I was about to make, and I just went. It was a bit disappointing because it didn't trickle down my legs, instead it went through the pants I was wearing as if I was just using the toilet normally, but the puddle was still large enough to require a couple of towels to get everything up.

Thank you for the advice
