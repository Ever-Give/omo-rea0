Haunted houses are about to be starting up again. I was curious to see if anyone has any stories of ever using a haunted house as a setting for a public wetting of their own. Haunted houses are probably the most acceptable place for a public wetting to occur, yet no one would know if it were intentional.

I've always been interested with this idea and was just curious to see if anyone else has thought about it/had any stories to share. This year might be the year I give it a shot.
