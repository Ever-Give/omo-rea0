Any tips for losing control and having an accident?

I’ve wanted to recreate the 3-4 year old childhood feeling of waiting too long to go to the bathroom and wetting my pants, but I haven’t been able to lose full control. The best I’ve been able to do is lose spurts, but those just make my need die down just enough to where I can hold it again, but it hurts. By the time I do all that, I’m annoyed with having had to pee so bad for so long that I go ahead and pee, but it’s not from loss of control. I’ve tried rapid desperation, then standing still with my legs apart, standing on my knees, listening to running water, etc. I usually start this when I have to go so bad that I can’t think about anything else, but I haven’t been able to lose control and have that “oh, shit, it’s all coming out right now” feeling. Should I still wait longer to try standing up/on my knees? Any tips to speed the process up are greatly appreciated!
