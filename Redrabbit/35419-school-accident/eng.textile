I was 12. All of us girls were stood in a line waiting to go into the gym. I'd never had any accidents before but loved it when other people did. I wasn't mega bursting but I needed to wee. I was waiting for the teacher to come to ask to go. I got a sneeze building up and then finally sneezed but as I did I lost control of my bladder. I tried so hard to stop it but it just kept flowing going drip drip drip all down my legs and made a huge puddle on the floor. I was so embarrassed and ashamed as my classmates giggled and gasped. One girl asked me if I had a weak bladder. I told her it was just an accident she then laughed and said "I didn't know people over 5 had them" from that day on I was known as puddles. I hated the experience but thankfully that's my only time.
