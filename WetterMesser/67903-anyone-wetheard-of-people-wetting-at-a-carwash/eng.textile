Hello! I am thinking of taking a job at a carwash over the summer and thought how it might relate to omo. Because we are expected to be wet and to wear dark clothing (specifically, black shorts), I figured it would be easy and convenient to simply wet myself if I have to go to the bathroom during a shift. Has anyone ever heard of this/done it themselves?
