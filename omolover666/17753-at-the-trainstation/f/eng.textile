I'm new to this website, but I'm glad I found it

I had one accident in my life. At least only one I can remember. I hope you like my story.

So I was walking back to the train station with some friends after a party. My friends had to catch the last train to their hometown and I had to catch the last one to mine. Only my train left an hour later then theirs. When their train left I noticed I already had to go pretty bad. The train was already there, but the doors weren't open yet. So I waited on the station, near the train. The toilet facilities on the station were closed. They always close them past 11 pm. I thought I could hold it for another 45 minutes. 

But after 15 minutes I had to go so badly that it was hurting my bladder. I pressed the "open" button on the train door, but it was still locked. It was terrible having to pee so bad while there is a toilet right there in the train, but you can't reach it. After another 5 minutes I just couldn't hold it anymore. I was standing by the door of the train, and I just started peeing. The pee was coming out and I felt it going down my legs. It wouldn't stop for like a full minute. I peed so much. When I completely emptied my bladder into my dark blue jeans, the doors of the train opened. Luckily the train stayed almost empty and I could go home without anyone seeing my accident. Or at least nobody that I know of.

That's my story :)
