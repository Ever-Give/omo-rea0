Personally, i have two time periods i've ever recorded.

In a full 24 hour period, none at all. Yes, it sounds crazy until I explain i was lacking in water the whole time.

Where it gets exciting, is in a week.

I managed to survive one week over a summer vacation where I only peed 10 times, all on myself. At the time, I was in a bit of an omo craze and still uninformed on the dangers of holding so much. My bladder was in almost constant pain, and my laundry afterwards was hellish, but I did it. I only ever left my room to bathe, and only once to go #2, Even then, my bathroom is in my room, so I wouldn't count it. I had a minifridge stocked to the brim with bottled water, I even brought enough food with me to maintain the 800 Cal Per day diet I had going at the time.

Now, i've told my stories, what about yours? Perhaps a day where you spent a great amount of time filled to bursting? Or the worst best week of your life?
