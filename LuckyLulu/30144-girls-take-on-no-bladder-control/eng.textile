Short story for you all, because I'm incredibly bad at writing and typing, so I'm doing you a favor by keeping this all brief.

Ever since I was a little girl, I have had little to no control over my bladder. At first, when I was a normal person, this was obviously a huge problem, because I needed to wear diapers almost constantly.

As the years have gone on however, I've gotten used to the feeling of suddenly having a warm wet spot in my pants. I still haven't gained any control over it, but hey, at least I've accepted it right?

To make a long story short, the accidents now aren't just because I can't control it.
