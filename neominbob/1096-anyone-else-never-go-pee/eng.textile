Hey. My friends always tell me i have a ginormous bladder. On a typical day, I'll go pee in the morning when I get up, when I get home from school, and just before I go to bed. I try to avoid the bathrooms at school (as my friends usually do, their usually squirming and holding themselves while im just feeling the first signs of needing to pee) unless I have to go super bad, even then il usually just try and hold it (though ive had a few close calls). So, I'm wondering, how often do you all pee, and does anyone else have a "ginormous" bladder? ;-)
