The biggest mistake

A few years ago I was in work trip somewhere about 400 km from home. I had a long (boring) meeting during that I drank 2 big coffees and a cup of tea.

I had then about an hour drive back to hotel. As soon as I left the building I felt the urge of pee. I started to regret not to ask for a bathroom. Anyway I thought I'd manage. I'm a big boy, big boys do not pee their pants do they?

After 20 minutes I've realised that it will be miracle if I arrive dry. I decided that it would be easier to hold if I let go a little bit. And I did it...

Few second later I observed I cannot stop it again. I peed myself. I peed my suit, my car seat and even my shirt. That was a thriller. The worst thing: I didn't have anything to change because all my staff was in the hotel. I tried not to show too much when I've taken a key...

So the lesson for me was not to try this "decreasing pressure" again.
