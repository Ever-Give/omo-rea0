So, my wife has a bad issue with holding her pee, not on purpose, but she also has over active bladder, she will feel the need to pee but hold it anyway even if the urge is strong. She will say she needs to go pretty badly, but will not for 3 or 4 additional hours.

She has an iron bladder or that of a horse.

Today she said she almost had an accident at work. She said that she was in the stall pulling down her pants, and a good size spurt leaked out, by her account it made her panties wet and a small spot on her pants. Like you had to be looking at hard to see it she said.

So she took a shower and I felt her panties, she soaked them clearly.

She will even hold it till the point she leaks at home then go pee.

She was really embarrassed about what happened, but she also said if she sets a timer she would ignore it and keep holding her pee. Right now she works at Target in packing online orders. I understand how busy she is.
