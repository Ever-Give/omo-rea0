How I Had a Genuine Wetting Accident

I've found that my bladder has an almost insane tolerance to large amounts of liquid, and that honest accidents are quite the challenge. When I had gotten my first ever actual accident, it was through the rapid desperation method. My bladder was bulging super far out and it felt like one wrong move would leave me a wet mess, but somehow I was still holding on. It wasn't until I challenged myself to run a somewhat cold stream of water from my shower head onto my thighs that I honestly could not keep it in. It was actually orgasmic, peeing without any control over it at all or choice in the matter- even after I moved the water away I just could not stop peeing myself into the tub.

Since then I haven't been able to exactly replicate the experience, but I must say I've never had a holding/wetting moment quite as wonderful as that one.

Would love to hear your own experiences with control over wetting
