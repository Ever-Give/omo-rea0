West Bound and Up

I was driving home the other day from where I went a-camping

West bound and up, meanwhile the tension started amping.

My bladder it began to bulge, and I was getting frantic.

I didn't want to wait; this really wasn't how I planned it

But I sized the situation up and looked around the cab

No bottles, just a million billion napkins that I had.

Slightly did I move my car seat backwards on its track.

My zipper went ZPPP and my button went SNAP

Down my pants and underwear went my absorbent friends.

And it wasn't long at all before I soaked through all of them.

I felt like such a mess, but some part of it made me giddy...

I touched myself until I finally pulled into my city.

Only when the light came on, I saw wet piles stack up

Dispose of all the evidence and zip my pants back up.

A warm and cozy bath to wash the icky all away.

Then I thought to myself, I'll do it all again someday...
