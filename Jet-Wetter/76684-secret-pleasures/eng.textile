Just a quick experience that needed sharing with everyone - if you don't mind... house full of guests this morning, and I'm just in a dressing gown having got a few things ready for breakfast; noticed a bunch of laundry needed doing so, spreading them out infront of the washing machine a devious thought crossed my omorashi-filled mind... Despite people moving around quite nearby, and an imminent risk of "I'll do that, you do the x/y/z", I positioned myself hopefully non-obviously above a pile of washing as I crouched before the machine, and let out first a couple of deviant spurts, and then with more confidence, a bit of a torrent of hot golden pee over the laundry just inches below me; it soaked one jumper fully, and left a little puddle on the floor which was quickly mopped up with a t-shirt, and the whole lot was quickly thrown in the washing machine without any evidence. Extra rinse just to make sure...

I hope my deviant adventure adds a bit of spice to your sunday morning
