Have you or anyone you know ever had to pee so bad on your way home that when you got home and got out of a car you literally had to pee so bad you weren't going to make it to the door without peeing your pants and, rather than doing that, decided to drop your pants and pee outside in your yard/driveway? Most interested in hearing about women doing this lol.

Could also apply to being locked out and deciding to pee outside rather than wetting.

More times than I can count getting out the car, or walking up to the door.

Any good stories stand out?

I'm a major exhibitionist, so I pee outside very often. These specific scenarios have only happened to me three times though. 4 hour beach road trip and an extra large milkshake lead to squatting on the side of the highway. Heading to the airport and stuck in traffic, had to ask my Lyft driver to pull over and partially peed my panties. And one time I got locked out of my hotel room at a convention, and ended up peeing on a potted plant, which turned out to be plastic.

Those are awesome, thank you. Any chance you'd be willing to tell any of those stories in detail from start to finish?

Absolutely I would! I'm pretty new to this site, so should I drop them here, or in peeing experiences?

Thank you! Did you end up putting them in experiences?
