Hand towels in pants - a fun way of wetting

I've found what might be my new favourite way of indulging in this fetish:

Today, when I got up needing to pee moderately, I put on several layers of boxers, with either a hand towel or a dish cloth separating of them. I then went about my studying for the upcoming exams while drinking many many mugs of tea, coffee, and hot squash. After a while I was very desperate and began to wee in small slow spurts. A couple of times I went outside to my doorstep to let some spurts out, but that was as public as I'm brave enough to do

After a few hours of spurting in my pants (while keeping up the fluid consumption), no urine had reached my trousers, and I needed to go very badly indeed. I stood in the bathroom just in case (tiled floor, easier to mop up), and a bit less slowly let the remainder out. Shockingly, while pee did run down my legs, I managed to let it out slowly enough that my trousers had time to absorb it, and only a few drops landed on the floor!

The warmth of doing this feels brilliant - I've done several whole bladderfuls of urine in my clothes, with almost none escaping. Right now I am wearing almost every drop of wee I have let out today!

I'd heartily recommend this - it feels brilliant
