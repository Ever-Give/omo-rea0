When I was studying at the institute, I was embarrassed to go to the toilet, so I urinated at home, then went to school at about 13.00. Lessons usually ended at 19.00. So it was on the day when my bladder was about to explode. After school we decided to go to a bar, where I drank 2 large cocktails. An hour later the urge was strong, but I decided not to go to the toilet, but after half an hour it started The last time I urinated was at 13.00 and it was already 21.00. I felt as if there was a bowling ball in me, a feeling of bursting, I liked it. 

But then there were very strong urges. I went to the toilet, but I could not urinate. I was scared, ran out of the bar and ran to the subway home faster to get into the bathtub to turn on the water and calmly urinate. In the subway I could not stand, I could only sit with my legs wide apart, then I did not feel the pain from an overflowing bladder. about a girl who could not urinate for several days and had 3 liters in her bladder. Arriving home, I ran into the bathtub and turned on the water. I urinated for a long time in a thin stream. And after 10 minutes a normal stream went.
