So I have been a Dungeon Master for Dungeons and Dragons for about 2 years now, and as such I have developed a few house rules. One of these is "If you gotta pee outta game, your character has to pee in game." Now I have never seen a genuine accident, I have had several described to me by cute nerdy girls as a result of this rule. Several characters have peed them selves in the middle of a fight, several have wet the bed and more than a few have run off desperately into the woods. I was very lucky to have run a campaign with my girlfriend and a Very good female friend of mine (very flirty), both of whom know of my interests...lets just say I got some very vivid details out of the two....Just thought Id share. If anyone would like to know any particulars then respond to this thread.
