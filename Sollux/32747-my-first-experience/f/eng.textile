I just has my first wetting experience.

I went onto Omegle to find someone to play with. After a few seconds, I got someone with the same interests. We chatted for a bit, (I was looking for someone to play with). He was really curious of what was my kinks are and everything. He ordered me to pee on towel, and, well, I did. I felt really dirty, but it felt good. Then he ordered me to drink 5 glasses of water and I couldn't go to the bathroom until morning, if I didn't urinate on my bed, I would have to wear the wetted underwear all day tomorrow. We switched to another app so we could keep talking.

He made a rule for me, I got to ask him if I could release my bladder, if he didn't response back, and I couldn't hold it, I would have to go in my pants if I was home alone, if I was with my friends or something at home, I would have to go in my underwear.

(He made another rule for tonight, for calling him "dude" instead of Master. If I have to go tonight, I wouldn't be allow to use a towel for protection)

I had a lot of fun.
