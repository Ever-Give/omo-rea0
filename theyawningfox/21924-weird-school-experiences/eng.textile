There was this weird thing I liked to do on the slide in first grade: I liked to rush down the slide, even when other people were on it. One day this girl, let's call her Brooke, was on it. So naturally, I rushed down the slide and ended up kicking her. Then her friend, let's call her Debbie, asked if she still had to pee. Brooke said something along the lines of, "I think I need new pants," or something like that, I couldn't really tell. So they went to talk to the ladies who were outside and, while I couldn't hear them, I saw a small wet patch on the back of Brooke's pants...

And in second grade, pretty much the entire class except me had to go to the bathroom but the teacher wouldn't let any of them. After a bit of agony from everyone else, there was suddenly this huge "ahhh" sound. There were no puddles or anything, just everyone who had to go felt relieved somehow, and there was one girl who said, "It hurts if you have to go real bad." I just sat there with no idea what the heck just happened, and the teacher just had this huge WTF face. A little bit later the girl who said it hurts if you have to go real bad came up to the teacher and asked if she could use the bathroom, and the teacher was like, "But I thought you didn't have to go anymore!" So I don't know if it was false relief or their need did disappear for some reason.
