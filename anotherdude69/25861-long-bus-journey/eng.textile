Ok, so this is my first time posting an experience so sorry if i don't write it too well.

When I was 16 I went on a school skiing trip to Austria which turned out to be a 26 hour bus ride, I used the bathroom before i left home and went to school to get on the bus. After a few hours we stopped at a service station and I went in the bathroom, but back then I was VERY pee shy so I couldn't go, so I just got back on the bus without going. I held it all the rest of the day and went to sleep on the bus, when I woke up we was somewhere in Germany I don't know where and by then I REALLY needed to pee but I was too shy to ask where the bathrooms were, so again I just held on. When we finally got to the hotel I was still holding on but only just, my boxers were starting to get a bit damp. I finally got to the room I was sharing with a friend and managed to used the bathroom.

Sorry it's a bit short but wanted to share the story. Hope you enjoy :)

Ummm I actually don't remember the journey back, I don't think there was an issue, I just drank a lot less.

By the end i was starting to squirm a bit but somehow i managed to keep it all under control. being as shy as i am i was determined not to let anyone know how bad i had to go.
