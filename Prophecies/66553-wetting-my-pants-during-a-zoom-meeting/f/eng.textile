Wetting my pants during a Zoom Meeting

So because of the pandemic, I've been working from home for over a year now. Every morning we have what we call "dailies", where we meet on zoom to discuss the work that's been done, and what needs to be done by end of day. Sometimes these meetings can go on a while, depending on how busy the weeks are. Lately the thought of wetting myself during one of these meetings has crossed my mind. At first I dismissed it as silly and ridiculous because it's work, and not the time to do that. But as time went on, the more I felt like doing it. So one fateful morning I had a few cups of coffee, went to sit at my desk for the meeting. I had to go. Real bad. So instead of excusing myself and going to the bathroom, I held it.

Before long, I had to mute my microphone, and just flood my jeans. Sitting there in a big puddle and hearing it drip on the floor was exciting, but I had to remain composed and pay attention to the meeting. It felt so wrong, yet so nice.
