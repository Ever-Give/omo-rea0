When a planned wetting doesn't work well – ?

After a long "drought," I've finally managed, just now, a "decent" (oxymoron, lol?) hold and wet. (Problem is getting enough privacy.)

I dressed in stuff that I could safely pee in – wash if possible, disposable if not. (Old jeans, briefs, long underwear to make it run down legs, T-shirt.) .I put plastic protection and a towel on my (new) office chair, also on the floor. Then over the past 3 hours or so I drank 3 pints of beer and a few glasses of wine. Read over some of the best "Wetting Experiences" stories. Loved them!

Well ... during this I leaked quite a bit (age maybe?), which I would have preferred to save for the planned big release. Eventually I stood on the prepared area (with a mirror to see the effect).

It was hard to make it start (using pressure &c on bladder area) ... finally it started, flowed quite a bit! It never got to my (disposable) socks and slippers, but soaked the jeans. (Found out after, the new chair got wet in spite of the protection!) :(

Two problems – there wasn't enough volume to soak and wet satisfactorily ... and it wasn't (sexually) stimulating enough.

Given that age might be a problem, as well as concern about privacy ... am I expecting too much? Can I do something differently that would work better?

Thoughts and suggestions from any of you in a similar situation would be most welcome.
