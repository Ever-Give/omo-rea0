Today I had some home alone time so I took one of the old diapers from the attic, they don't fit me but I can wear them as a (big) pad. Well anyway, I had taken a load of water and my bladder was very full. The only reason I didn't wet was because of my erection. Well I wanted to re position myself in my chair and made a weird turn, which gave a strong pain in my back. My erection disappeared and I pissed uncontrollably, I could hardly feel that I was doing it but I could feel some warmth and a swelling diaper. Well the pain in my back quickly disappeared and lets say that I had a lot of fun afterwards. When I put the diaper away I could see that it was 95% full, only a small patch in the back wasn't at least 4cm thick.
