I've had bladder problems when I was younger but it wasn't due to any infection, I just had problems controlling myself. As a result, I used to frequently wet the bed which is embarrasing to this day, and my whitey-tighties were always stained at the front because of my lack of control. Most of the time I didn't realize what happened or just had to let out a little and wait until I found a bathroom. I was almost in diapers because my parents were so concerned but I fixed my problems by making frequent bathroom visits.
