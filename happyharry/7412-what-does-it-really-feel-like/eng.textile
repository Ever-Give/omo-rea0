I've been reading accounts of women peeing their pants for honestly almost 20 years. But I really have never read an intimately detailed account of what a girl (woman) feels when they finally can't hold it any more. We've all seen the, "she felt a warmth in her panties and down her left thigh" kinda thing, but I know there's more to it (or at least I hope so). There must some very creative women out there that can find the words. I'm hoping there are quite a few. Regardless, it would be very cool to finally get the straight scoop. And, I thank anyone who contributes very much in advance.

Thanks Corrina for responding. I like and appreciate your input. Particularly the details about an accident.
