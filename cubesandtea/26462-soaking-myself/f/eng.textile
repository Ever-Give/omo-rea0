Well, this is something I decided to try out last night. It didn't work as well as I expected, but it was still very fun!

It was about 10 PM, and I was laying down in bed. My bladder was bursting, and I sure as heck didn't want to get up. Then, an idea popped into my head. Beside my bed, there was a trash bag. No idea why it was there. I grabbed it, causing more liquid to slosh around in my bladder. I set it underneath me and threw all my covers aside so I would not get pee on them. Then I let go. The golden liquid filled the trash bag in an instant and it began to flood out onto my bed. I was peeing for a solid 45 seconds, and then I stopped. I lay there for a few minutes, sitting in my own warm pee, and I just relaxed. The peeing feeling was amazing.

So yeah, I had to wash my sheets after that and the trash bag was hard to discard, but I'll say it was worth it..
