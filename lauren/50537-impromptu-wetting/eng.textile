Impromptu Wetting

Normally if I plan on wetting myself I'll make a bit of a plan (wait till my roomates are gone, drink a certain amount per hour, etc.) and then improvise. But a few days ago, I had a pretty big urge to pee when I was just hanging out playing a bit of EU4. So, as any omoslut would do, I ran to the sink, drank a cup of water, and then filled it back up. Starting to squirm really badly, I decided to text a fellow wetting fan (if you're reading this, hello master!) about my predicament, and we had a bit of the usual back-and-forth.

At one point, I was told to press my bladder a bit, to which I of course complied. As I pushed in, the pain spiked, and I involuntarily spurted a bit as my body tried to free up some room. Instead of getting better though, letting that much out made my panties nice and warm, just daring my body to let the rest out...

Always the crowd pleaser, I set my phone up on my desk and filmed the final collapse.

Afterwards I managed to successfully sneak past my roomates to the shower, still in my totally soaked pants. With all the tension from the hold and sneaking around, you can probably imagine what happened once I got to the shower lol!
