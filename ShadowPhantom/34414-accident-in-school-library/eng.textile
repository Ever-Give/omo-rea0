This story is a memory from a while ago but yeah.. here it is: Back when I was in 8th grade, my school had all these strict rules. The whole environment felt like jail! They would only let you to the bathroom at certain times and many other annoying rules. I was in the library with the rest of my class. The teacher had us gather on the carpet, and she would read us a short story. This happens every Friday when we have the opportunity to borrow a book, she reads us a nice story. This was an unfortunate day for me. I asked to go to the bathroom before the library session even started, however she said no. She said that I should have gone at lunch, since this was the period directly after lunch.

The urge only got stronger, and when we got to the read aloud, it was unbearable. I sat there, hoping I could make it through, but 3 minutes into the read aloud, I gave in to my bladder. I let it trickle out slowly and quietly into my panties, and into my jeans. I smiled at my friend next to me for some reason while in the act. At the rate I was going, it took me a minute to finish peeing. Luckily, there were no visible signs of what I did. The smell of pee was not present either. Then I sat there, wondering how the heck I would get out. I ended up leaving last and covered the area that was wet with the book I borrowed. I survived :D
