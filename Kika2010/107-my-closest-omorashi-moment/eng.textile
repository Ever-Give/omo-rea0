Well, I've never had a time where I peed myself (except when I was really small, like 5, I wet the bed once), but I do remember one close experience where I almost wet myself. I was about 8 or 9 years old when this happened.

I was in Dominican Republic with my family for vacation and was visiting my grandpa's house. Now, the time between the house we stay in there and my grandpa's house is about 1-2 hours. During the road home, I had to pee really badly. I remember pressing my legs together and physical holding my crotch so that I would wet myself in the car. I tried to distract my bladder with my mind but I kept thinking of things related to liquid,water, pee, etc XD. I didn't tell my parent I needed to pee cause I thought they'd get annoyed.

I thought that I wouldn't make it. But luckily, my dad stopped at this outside bar and snack shop that had a restroom. I remember him saying "I have to use the bathroom. Does anybody else have to go?" and I was like "ME!!!! ME!!!! ME!! ME!!" XD and I pushed my brother next to me just to get out of the car XD. I ran to the restrooms, but the restrooms were unisex and had only one toilet. and the stall had no door >_< . So I told my dad to stay in front of me so that no one would see me pee. Then I went and I felt completely relieved lD .

Lol What a weird story I have XD.
