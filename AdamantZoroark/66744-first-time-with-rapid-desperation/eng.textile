First time with rapid desperation

I woke up way earlier than usual and had the house to myself for a while, when I remembered that I wanted to go buy a black pair of jeans to use in a future hold. I figured (perhaps with some persuading in the OmoOrg discord), hey, why not give them a test wetting?

I decided to use the rules for Bombality's Big Bladder Battle; time would only start after I had drank 500 ml, after which I would drink another 500 ml over 30 minutes, then drink 250 ml every 30 minutes until there was a wet spot my hand could no longer cover. I started to feel an urge before even finishing the first 30 minutes and, after hitting the hour mark, I was really struggling. I kept on holding on, stubbornly refusing to let go, and managed to make it to the 1 hour 30 minute mark to finish one last cup of water. After that, I made it a little harder for myself by rebuttoning my jeans and, a few minutes after finishing that last cup, was having an uncontrollable accident! I never even had any leaks that I could stop; once I started leaking, I just couldn't stop it from coming out!

I had to get out a mop to clean up the huge puddle I left at my feet, but all in all, I was amazed at how quickly I got desperate using these rules. I'm sure to be using this strategy for rapid desperation in the future
