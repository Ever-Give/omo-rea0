Hello everybody! I would like to ask a question to all lovers of holding the pee until you lose control. Does anyone here know the first symptoms before they know that they have a tired bladder and the pee is going to come out uncontrollably? I've been trying to do it all day and I just let it out because it already hurts.

I have been drinking and holding for hours and when I had the need I went to the toilet, but it has not helped me at all. Finally, I had to let it all out because it hurt, but I never lost control.
