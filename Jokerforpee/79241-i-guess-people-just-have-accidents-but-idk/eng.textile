Okay so this isn’t really kink related but more something I noticed but.

A lot of people seem to have at least one story about them pissing themselves as an adult. They don’t even need to be into it, they’ll just causally talk about how they pissed because they got too drunk or laughed too hard. Like every adult gets at least one accident then never again. So I’m just on the assumption that it’s a common thing but I could be wrong or be surrounded by/watch people who secretly into piss.
