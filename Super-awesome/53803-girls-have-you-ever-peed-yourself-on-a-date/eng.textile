Girls, have you ever peed yourself while on a date? If so, did your date know you was into omorashi and what happened after?

Already wrote about this on a thread, but on my first date with another girl (16ish) we went to see a movie and around halfway through I felt the urge to pee. I must have been nervous because I decided to hold it. The movie finished and we started walking home, me desperately trying to hold it all in. We got to her house first and we said our goodbyes, and just before she went inside I just couldn’t hold it and started completely flooding myself. It was night but I was wearing light grey jeans so you could clearly see the streaks running down my legs. She was grossed out, so no second date happened

Sorry to hear that. I don't see that as an excuse to break off any kind a relationship. Gross stuff happens in life.
