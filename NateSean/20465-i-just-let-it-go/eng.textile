Today was free coffee and donuts day in the break room. I can resist the donuts but the coffee is my siren call and I had to pee about forty times today. My coworker gave me a ride home at the end of my shift and I was already feeling the need to pee.

She got pulled over because her headlight was out and you know how long that can take. The urge just kept building and by the time the officer had written her warning, I was already getting desperate.

Because my actual apartment is a good chunk of the way out of her commute, she drops me off at the movie theater just a few breaks from where I live. A combination of factors like the rain and the cool air made it worse as my bladder just screamed to be let go. Well, since I'm planning to do laundry tomorrow anyway, as I got to the sidewalk just outside of my building, I let it go.

I love the feeling of releasing a stream of urine into the cloth of my khakis. I like watching the wetness spread and eventually seeing the stream pour from my pant leg. The only thing that I hate is that there's no one there to watch or "catch" me.

Well, not in her car obviously, that would have made her day worse. My ideal for getting caught is hopefully by a stranger with a "big brother" or "nurturing parent" complex. I know it's more likely that people will think I'm drunk or deranged and I can only promise them that I'm not one of the two.
