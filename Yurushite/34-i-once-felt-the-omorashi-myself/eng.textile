It was five years ago, I went to the bathroom for my morning pee, at 7:00. In recess time, at 11:00, I had to go, but, I thought I would be able to hold it or something like that. I don't remember quite well. Anyway, I was so dumb that I didn't go on the second recess at 13:30 I asked the teacher for the bathroom (for the very first time since I entered that school) and he refused. I had to continue drawing (it was art class). To make things worse, I kept remembering an omorashi fantasy of mine (not really omorashi since I didn't know it existed back then, but you get the point). Some time after, I asked again with a very embarrasing "please" and he let me. I ran and made it, but I had been so desperate. Since then, I go to the bathroom EVERY recess, even if I don't really need to pee.

Total time elapsed: 7:00 to 14:00 (aprox) = 7 hours. That just sucks D:
