I've been doing this recently and basically im a chicken, i love wetting myself while walking my dog but at the same time I dont actually want to be caught so its usually when I take my dog for a walk round the block after sunset so no one can really see, I start off early, 2 mins from my house ill relax and just get my boxers a bit bet and hopefully not visible. Then for the next 15 minutes of my walk ill be leaking just a little then on the final stretch I have to be careful as I have a large bladder and there's a shop opposite my house and yes its open late so as long as there's not too many people I will release fully as I'm walking the last few minutes down to my house and by that time my jeans are soaked all the way down to my socks and trainers. Always good fun.

Yeah black is the go to but I do like the classic blue jeans for the extra risk because of the visible dark patch.
