Sat in that chair forever with my jaws jacked open and could not get up for a bathroom break.

I ended up wetting myself right there in the dentist chair, and needless to say, they were not overly thrilled ... but I was!

I sat there in my soggy khaki work pants for another twenty minutes or so as they finished the procedure, and as I got out of the chair, I shallowly apologized for my "mishap," checked out with the receptionist and left through the waiting room with people looking at me like I had a social disease or something. Jaw pain, novcaine, and wet britches .. what a nice trip to the dentist!
