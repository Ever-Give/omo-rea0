Now tonight at 23:45 I will spend a night doing yoga and listening to the sound of water, please write down how many hours I should hold or how many glasses of water I should drink, I have already drank 5 glasses of water and now I want to force my bladder to the end, I will not mind the pain of my bladder while doing yoga. I will sleep without urinating at night, drink plenty of water, do yoga and listen to the sound of relaxing water. I don't need to pee to be happy Drinking water yoga and meditation give me pleasure now my bladder is swollen and I hope it continues to swell.
