This happened in 2014. I was at a Robbie Williams concert with my wife in Copenhagen. On the way to the concert she said that it was ok if I didn't went to the toilets if I was in that mode. Already after the first beer when the warm up band was on ,I started to feel the need to go. But I thought it would be to early so I went to the toilet and bought more beers. After a couple of more beers and a couple of numbers with Robbie my bladder was pretty full. I took my arms around my wife, whispered in her ears that I needed to go and then just relaxed. 

She smiled and I started to pee massively in my light jeans. Both shoes we're wet and I was dripping. My wife went out for another beer and I didn't take me long to fill up my bladder again. It was getting dark so I just started to empty my bladder each time I felt the need. I peed several times and I was totally soaked when the concert was over. It was a stadium concert so it was only grass under me. Apparently people around us didn't really reacted, I think a lot did notice it and some smiled and laughed a bit. The walk home to the hotel was a fantastic thrill....
