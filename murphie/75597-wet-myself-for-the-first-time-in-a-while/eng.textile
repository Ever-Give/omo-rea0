Hey y’all!

It’s been a little bit since i wet myself - in fact, i think this morning was the first time i have this year. i didn’t really plan to do this, but once the idea hit me, it really took hold.

I started my morning how i usually do - by having two cups of coffee while i watch tv, except this time, when the urge to pee hit, I didn’t get up to go.

Instead, as my bladder started to fill up i decided to push myself. i grabbed a glass of water and sat down, knowing i wasn’t going to let myself make it to the toilet

It didn’t take too long until i was squirming and holding onto myself. i decided to watch videos of others losing control and that’s when i couldn’t take it anymore.

I ran to the bathroom, leaking the whole way. by the time i got there, there was already a significant wet spot on my gray sweatpants.

I got into the bathtub just as the floodgates completely broke. my legs were shaking so badly from the effort, i dropped down into my own puddle while it grew.

After i caught my breath and registered id had an accident for the first time in a while, i played a little through my wet pants and had the most intense orgasm I’ve had in a while
