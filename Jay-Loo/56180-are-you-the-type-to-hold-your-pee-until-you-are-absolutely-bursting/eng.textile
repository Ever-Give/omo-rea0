Are you the type to hold your pee until you are absolutely bursting?

If so, what situations has this lead to? Embarrassing pee dances or wettings..or anything else?

I'm not the type to, when I'm out I try to take care of that whenever I get the chance, only if I'm at home at times I might decide to just wait until the last minute mostly if I'm planning on a long desperation hold. But curious to hear other's stories..planned holdings or any games not being included for this topic, wherever you are, do you usually hold your pee until you are absolutely dying to go?

Asking because I've known a few people throughout my life that were that way, and would pee dance but still wait...then suddenly they are running off to go pee. Mostly women are who I've known to do this, just my experience, obviously that can be both men and women...I think...
