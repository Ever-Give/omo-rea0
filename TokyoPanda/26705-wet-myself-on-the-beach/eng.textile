I was at the beach today, and I had a bit of fun. I drank a lot of Gatorade today (makes me need to pee fast), and I swam a bit with my girlfriend, Madison. After about an hour, I really had to pee. I kept holding, but Maddi went back to the house. I waited a bit more, and decided I should try to wet myself on accident. I laid on a towel and tried to take a nap, but I couldn't fall asleep. I let a little pee out, and finally nodded off. When I woke up, my bladder was almost empty, and I was soaked. I rolled in it a bit, and rung out the towel. I have never wet myself so much before! I realized that since I was wearing my jean shorts, people could tell I had wet myself. Oops! I ended up just taking off the shorts since I was wearing my swim suit suit under it. This was the best wetting I have EVER had, and I'll do some more while I'm here. I plan on doing one tomorrow, so keep checking for more!

Sorry this is so short, I forgot to type this up, and it got pretty late.
