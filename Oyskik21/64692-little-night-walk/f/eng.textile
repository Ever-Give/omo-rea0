Little night walk

Hi all! Reading all the awesome stories on this forum made me determined to finally do what I’d been meaning to do for a long time - to hold my piss all the way up until I totally lost control I thought it might be worth recounting!

At a solid 7/10 and all horned up from browsing the forum, I headed out for a nice long nighttime walk. I knew my normal route would be quiet, so it felt like the perfect opportunity

By the time I made it to the half way point, my walk started becoming a waddle. I could feel my bulging bladder straining against the elastic of my shorts - just as I planned, I wouldn’t be making it home dry!

It was at the start of a big hill that I felt the first spurt shoot into my underwear - I had to stop and bend over, squeezing my dick until the wave subsided. I probably had three more spurts before I started to reach the home stretch of the walk... I thought I might make it home after all!

But not quite - a sudden noise startled me, and a second later I felt myself give in entirely. I grabbed hold of a nearby tree branch for support as my bladder released, and I felt a waterfall of hot steamy piss run into my shorts and down my legs. It felt so good against the chilly nighttime air.

After making sure the last of my bladder was emptied, I stood there for another minute, feeling warm, weak and satisfied. That was the best walk I’d had in a while
