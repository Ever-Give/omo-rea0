Sorry for my english all that i'm about to tell was true and happened on september 2001.

We're on holiday in turkey, all the newspaper and local tv show the attack on world trade center NYC, but we have to move from istanbul to ankara about 900 kilometers by bus, the guide warn us to use the restroom before boardiong the bus because we don't make any stop on the track. now it's time to go we all goes into the bus, and we started our trip, but less than half an hour later a middle aged lady asked something to the guide, i could only hear her response, you're all warned mrs ... we can't stop here, the lady come back to her seat, and i don't believe to my ears she need to go and there are still 10 hours of travel until we arrive, she could'n resist so much, i was so exited that i started to watch her she was not much tall and fat, but she's seem normal not in desperate condition, but the journey is still long.

After 3 hours she begin to show her urge she come back to the guide that gave her the same response, i follow her body movement from my seat, she walks slowly and the panic in her face says it all, she returned to her seat, another hour later she was frantic, she's squirming and fidgetting, she's crying, that scene i will never forget she got up from her seat and slowly walk into the ladder then watch a woman and told her sorry a cant wait no more she raise up her skirt and pull down her panties and in front of all she pee into the ladder an enormous stream i can't believe she can hold so much pee in her bladder, once she finished, red in face she pull up her panties and come back to her seat
