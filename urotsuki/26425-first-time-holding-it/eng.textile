So today was my first experience of purposely holding my pee

It stayed around a 7 for a really long time while i was browsing omorashi blogs on tumblr

It was awesome but at one point I got worried it was bad for my health so

I decided to wait a little longer but not until i was leaking or anything

I didn't want to get the carpet wet at midnight or anything so I went into the shower and held it until i had to just let go because my heart was beating way too fast and my legs were shaking :/ and I had to take my boxers off bc idk when i can stealthly wash that shit

That's the very first time i did that, and i had to keep checking to make sure the shower didn't smell like piss

But shit im probably gonna do that more often, maybe hold longer if i can keep my heart rate down

Just wanted to share that experience :)
