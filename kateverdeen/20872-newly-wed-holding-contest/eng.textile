Hey Guys,

So we (Editine and I) are getting married this Sunday and we have decided to have a pee holding contest. We are allowed our last pee just before the ceremony, we'll both be posting status updates here.

Signing Off,

Yeah, ok, it never happened on the wedding day, things popped up, we've decided to delay it a little. So, we are allowed our last pee's at 8PM tonight. We might be on IRC at some points, lookout for the nicks: editine and ktlaelana

I've won the contest ;), I'm bladder queen of the house now haha.

It's 5PM AWST (GMT +8), 24:15 into the hold, it's starting to get hard to hold on, I've got to conscientiously clench to not leak, but I can still do other things.

I'm still going, though I'm leaking a few drops every couple of seconds, its sooo hard to hold on, even harder to type.

9:50PM AWST (GMT +8)

I couldn't hold it any longer, I peed myself about 5 mins ago, I'm still in wet clothes.

10:35PM AWST (GMT +8)

Total time: 29.75 hours. No capacity measurements today.
