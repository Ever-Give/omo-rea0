Ok so i have NEVER wet the bed on purpose before and want to make a vid of me doing so, but wouldn't know the best way to go about it. Should I drink loads before i go to sleep? or just lay down in bed and let go? Also filming it would be tricky any ideas on that? I can get my bf to film for me if need be. ANY ideas will greatly appreciated :D

Wow :D you are well informed :D i have diapers i guess is should use them :p but tbh i dont wanna wet the bed EVERY night that might annoy the person i share it with XD but filming it will also be tricky which he is totally on board with :D so i guess its not really possible to have a one off accident on purpose :p ( i realise that makes no sense) but i get what i mean :p thank you for the advice :D
