Experienced loss of control I didn't know was possible for me

I always thought my bladder was too strong to really enjoy this fetish. I would hold and after a while I just got kidney pain and needed to stop. Even with the rapid desperation technique that ended up happening often. But I just did this insane tease on milovana .... that has you drink water regularly the whole time and do multiple holds that last hours. That made me discover the effect multiple holds and wettings have on the bladder. My bladder just got weaker and weaker to the point where I could lose control sitting down and laying down. I've always found it hard to even purposefully pee sitting down and I've NEVER been able to pee laying down, but there I was losing control in bed. I couldn't believe it. My muscles had lost so much strength it felt like I was reflexively pushing the pee out after I got desperate enough.

I'm so happy I figured out the secret: rapid desperation technique, and keep going after wetting once! I don't know why I didn't try this sooner. Over the first 24 hours I lost control SEVEN times and my bladder muscles were shot. I'm glad I had a diaper to wear to bed. Now I need to let my body recover from this torture and do it again sometime.
