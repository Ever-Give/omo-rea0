Hi. I'm new here ans just wanted to share a quick experience. I left the house this morning wearing Depends men's underwater under my jeans. I had the day off, so after 3 cups of coffee, I hopped in my truck and set off to no place in particular. I stopped at a drive thru and got a large coke for good measure. I didn't take long before I no longer could hold it, and let my bladder go. No problem. Long story short, after the fourth time, the Depends had had enough! After I realized I was past the point of no return, I just went with it and completely let go twice more before I got home to safety with a very wet pair of jeans and truck seat. All in all, a very good start to the day! Thanks for reading. And thank you all for such an awesome Forum!
