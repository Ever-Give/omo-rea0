Hi all!

I fancied testing my capacity today, as I'd never really done that before. I hadn't leaked at all and could have maybe held a little longer, but was really desperate.

I was pretty pleased with the result, just over 1 L. I think that's pretty good tbh! What do you lot think? Feel free to post your max capacities if you know them!

PS. I've also attached a recorded audio of me peeing, nearly a minute and a half!
