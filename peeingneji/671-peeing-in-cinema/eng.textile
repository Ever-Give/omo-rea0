I was watching the new Harry Potter movie...

It was very nice until...I noticed that my bladder was very full, but, as you know, a film is exciting the whole time and if you exit for a short run to the toilet, you miss very much and you don't know, why the caracters in the movie are doing this...so I thought, the film isn't that long anymore (The film was already 1 and a half hour), I can hold it in...FAIL, Nagini, the snake of Voldemort, was suddenly coming out of a chest and I was so shocked, that I peed a bit in my pants, but I could stop it early enough, so I ran to the toilet and then it happened:

The pee was flowing and flowing and flowing...

Then I noticed that it doesn't feel that bad, if it wasn't in a cinema, so I sat down on a toilet and thought, how I can get out of there...

And sometimes I peed, of course...

How, do you think, did I get out of there? ;)
