Okay... since my "Um..." post i've gotten loads of very encouraging comments on my paranoia of wetting so... *deep breath* i tried to give it a go but i found as i got more and more desperate i just felt bruised... it really fucking hurt and i knew i wasn't even that desperate, i know this wasn't just a one time thing because i've tried it a few times now and i just give into the pain and go to the bathroom, but even after i'm left with this really bruised feeling, i don't find any of it enjoyable... i guess i'm just not built to do this... :(
