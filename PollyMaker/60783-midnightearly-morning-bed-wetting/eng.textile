About a night ago, I woke up at around 2am surrounded by silence and darkness. I felt slight pressure in bladder but thought nothing of it and tried going back to sleep. It only got worse, the pressure almost doubling every 10 minutes. Around 2:40am, the pressure was pretty unbearable. I’ve already tried to push out my pee, but it wouldn’t come out. I reach down and gently take hold of my penis, feeling the pressure build before a small leak started. It wasn’t much, but I felt relieved. I started drifting off to sleep again when the pressure started rising again. I took hold again, and out came a waterfall of piss.

About a solid 10-15 seconds of peeing in my PJs. Satisfied, I went back to sleep, my legs warm and wet. The next morning, I wake up to find my wet patch gone on my quilt. I knew my morning pee was coming, so I laid back down and let it out. Lo-and-behold, a big wet patch on my quilt. I take off my quilt and look at my mattress protector, two big yellow stains present (Pics Below). I take off my mattress protector, and disaster. My pee went through the mattress protector and stained my mattress. I quickly had to change my sheets and replace my mattress protector before anyone in my house noticed.

Lesson learned: Use a quality mattress protector, and not a cotton one.$$
