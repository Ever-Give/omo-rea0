I have the entire day to myself, so I decided that I'm going to avoid going to the bathroom from the moment I woke up until I go to bed tonight. It was really hard not going first thing in the morning! I'll be sure to keep you all updated.

Oooooh, sounds like loads of fun. :D Now I kinda hope my dad goes on a vacation by himself at some point in time so I can do the same thing.

Loads of fun indeed! :) I'm already having trouble sitting still...

Need to go very badly now, I have to keep one hand between my legs at all times.

I so would not last this long o.o

It's very difficult! I've never tried skipping my morning pee before, but I'm almost bursting now that I have!

Absolutely bursting right now. I feel like I'll go any second!

So er... how did it all go? :] Details.

Shortly after making that last post, I hurried to the bathroom to go. I must have gone for over two minutes before finally stopping! I didn't make it from morning to bed time, though. :( I'll have to try harder next time.
