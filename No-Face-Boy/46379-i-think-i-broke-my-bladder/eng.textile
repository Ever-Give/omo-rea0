So I wanted to do a hold last night so I began to drink 4 glasses of water right before sleep. I woke up in the morning needing to pee bad. I was very in the mood to hold a river inside my bladder so I got myself 1 other glass of water and another glass of milk... About an hour later I couldn't hold it anymore and my bladder was bulging out so much xD I had a lot of fun but now my bladder hurts a bit even if I don't have to pee at all.
