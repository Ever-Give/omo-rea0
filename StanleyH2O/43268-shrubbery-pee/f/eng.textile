None of my friends nor I liked putting off a pee, then go indoors to have to wait for a cousin or aunt to finish in the bathroom and another family member teasing us about our "dance." On August afternoons as a tween and early teen my Koo-Aid-drinking friends and i could get rather lazy about dealing with frequently-full bladders. We would avoid going indoors by peeing between a tall thick shrubbery and the house or detached garage. An abandoned chicken coop had been used for storage for a few years. It was supported on blocks a bit above ground and had electrical wiring for two bare bulbs. (The thing was as big as a school classroom.) It became a sort of club house. After we found everything of interest under the chicken house, we cut a hole in the floor of a small storage room. That was another unofficial sneaky place to pee. A few large evergreen trees also became unofficial rest rooms. Unlike the others, both girls and boys used evergreens thick vacant-lot brush.

Unofficial restrooms around your neighborhood?
