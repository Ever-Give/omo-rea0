Recently I found a way to rapidly filling the bladder, it sounds fun to play with but take quite a while to prepare:

First of all, at the start of the challenge, drink 250ml of cold water, repeat drinking the same amount of water after 15 mins interval. Keep drinking until 2hrs of the challenge starts. During this 2-hr period, go to toilet when you feel need to pee.

2hrs later, stop drinking (should drank 2.25L water) and not allowed to pee anymore. Then hold your pee for 1hr.

Somebody from other pee fetish forum said it was so hard to hold their pee, they literally ended up pee theirselves in less than an hour.

Did anyone tried that before? If not, are you going to try it? If you going to try it, please MUST NOT DRINK MORE THAN THE VOLUME OF WATER STATED ABOVE, OR YOU MAY GET WATER INTOXICATION.
