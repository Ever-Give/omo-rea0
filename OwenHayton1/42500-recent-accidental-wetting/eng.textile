Hi, so this literally just happened about 5 minutes ago. I was just sat on my bed watching youtube and I suddenly felt a pressure from my bladder but I tried to just ignore it and carry on. The feeling went away after a while and I was getting up to grab the charger and the feeling came back and I was desperately holding on but then I felt my hands get a little wet and I just conceded and pissed everywhere.

It feels really weird as this is the first genuine accident I've had in years.
