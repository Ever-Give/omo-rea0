Hi, first of all apologies if this has alrady been asked I have searched the forums and I am unable to find what I am looking for...

I want to start wetting the bed I have done it once and clean up was a nightmare so have now got a protective cover but I dont trust it enough and wondered what other people do and use in order to protect the mattress and duvet please?

My aim is drink some fluids before bed and when I wake up I will wet the bed any ideas on how to acheieve this would be great.

Many thanks and look forward to your responses
