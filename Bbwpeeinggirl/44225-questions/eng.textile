I’m wondering... how do I bring up to my partner that I want to experiment with pee? I would love for him to pee inside of me I feel like that would be an amazing experience. I’m unsure if he’s into that... so how would I suggest it. I’ve also wanted to send him videos on the toilet but wondered if he would freak out. How should I bring it up? I’ve only lately started to get turned on by it myself so I’m new around here.
