Have you ever heard a girl moan or comment on the relief when she peed?. I was out with a friend the other day and she had to pee so bad so she squated in a bush and i heard her say " ahhhhh that feels so good" and a low "ohhhhh" she really had to go.

As I don’t usually go in the ladies’ bogs, I’ve only heard this from family members. A couple of times women at work have made a comment after going about how much they needed it.

It’s common to heat men at urinals make sounds of relief, particularly at bars when they have full bladders and lowered inhibitions from drinking.

From family members? Mind telling us the story? Sorry i know it might be rude to ask about them.

I am certain I would remember an awesome experience like that , but unfortunately right now I can't recall any , in person anyway. I have seen realistic , believable videos on X tube though.

My ears always perk up if I hear a woman mention anything about pee. Key words I have to pee so bad grab my immediate attention . Words like that are the best I have got.

Would you mind linking those videos?:)

Can you tell us some stories then? What is the most you ever heard her moan while peeing?
