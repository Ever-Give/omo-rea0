A wet day in front of the postman

Yesterday I had been working at home and holding all morning. By lunchtime I was getting very desperate. I'd decided that any wetting I would do while in the garden as it was a nice day. Then the weather turned, the temperature dropped and it started to rain. Both increasing the urge. I was not at bursting point but enough to be uncomfortable. I decided to go out to the car to get some thing out. I was wearing a dress and no shoes....the weather was that fine drizzle that soaks really quickly. I dashed out to the car, but as I did the postie walked past.

Now he was on one side of the car and me on the other....he stopped to chat about the weather and how cold it had turned. That was enough for me....at first I let go and spurted just a little that ran down my closed legs, as the warmth felt good I found it impossible to stop. It was all I could do not to groan in pleasure in front of the postman. He had no idea what I was doing . I kept my legs together as my bladder emptied itself. He handed over my post across the bonnet of the car and as I leaned forward on the side of the car the last spurt escaped . Couldn't have planned it any better and although it wasn't directly infront of the postie it sure gave me a nice thrill knowing I'd just peed myself infront of him.
