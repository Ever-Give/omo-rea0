I remember sitting on a pretty carpet for story time. the rest of the class was sitting on the carpet too. and we had had these 'bathroom passes' there were two. when they were red that meant someone was in the bathroom. when it was green you were able to go use the bathroom. which i kinda don't understand why there was only two cause there were more than two stalls... but... i had to go and a kid had left the pass 'red' for awhile... it's like they forgot to change it back to green or something.. i kept thinking i wasn't allowed to get up to go. i didn't want to interrupt the teacher during story time. so i waited... and i eventually peed my pants on the carpet..sitting amongst the class mates... i think i remember being pretty upset about it. i remember i had to call my parents to come bring me clean clothes.

Wow what happened? did you go home to get a change of clothing? did you talk to that teacher after and tell them what happened?
