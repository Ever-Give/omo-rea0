So the other day i was catching the bus home, because i have to run for my bus daily, there is no time for toilet breaks. I got on the bus and i felt fine, but I swear i have incontinence. I had been on there for a good ten minutes then i felt the need. This was not the first time i had needed to go on the bus but I was still concerned. I had no way of telling how long i had n]before i needed to go because my brain doesn't like to tell me. It had been about thirty seconds and then I fully wet myself. 

I had no issue with this because I love the warmth but it was still on the bus seat. I try to wear skirts to school so that if the time calls and it happens, it isn't as noticeable. Along with that I always wear bike shorts or shorts on underneath. When I sit down i make sure that it is always only my shorts touching the seat so if a time like the other day. I can conceal it. How about you? Have any of you wet yourselves on a bus seat before? How can I stop this? And before any of you tell me to see a doctor, I don't want to. I like wetting myself.
