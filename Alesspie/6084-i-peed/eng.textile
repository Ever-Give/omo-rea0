I finnally did it, i peed in front of my bf! He didnt see anything cuse it was in the shower and the warm water was running. But i'm proud i did it.

I'm so shy and it was the only way the begin with.

I think it's really hard to do it in front of someone ;_; .. But yeh, it was a start..

It felt really nice blowing him while my warm pee ran down my legs, i held it in for so long, but i almost could'nt do it. .. Someone know how to get more relaxed so it gets easier?

Uhm,. Yes! I'm happy anyway. I needed to share it with someone :)

:). I will keep doing it, and i also belive it'll get easier.

If truth is to be told i think it's hard to do it when im alone also, not going on the toilet, but wetting myself, but the feeling when it's finally comming is priceless.

And to add, peeing while having an orgasm.. I love it. That feeling while you can't help yourself and it just keeps flowing.. . Gets me shivers thinking about it, even i havent done it so many times, maybe 3.

<3

So i will practice even more when i'm alone.. And i'll be sure to share it with you, if you want :o
