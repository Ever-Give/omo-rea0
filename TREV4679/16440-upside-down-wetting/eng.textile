So about a year ago I posted a thread on general discussion asking for ideas and somebody gave me the great idea who lay at an angle so the pee would run upwards towards my head so first thing in the morning I was home alone I ran into my backyard bursting to pee I ran over to the swing set in my backyard and got on the slide with my head facing the ground and my feet in the air and let it go it was amazing I could feel the pee running across my butt it made its way up my back around my neck and pooled at the bottom.

I thought this was a great suggestion and I'm looking for more so if you have any ideas let me know because I'm looking to wet within the next half hour. However I am a man and do not own any panties nor can I wet my bed I have just the typical clothes to wear gym shorts jeans baseball pants sweatpants I've tried just about everything I can think of so if you have any idea at all no matter how crazy feel free to comment

I want to apologize if I've posted this in the wrong place or not however I am fairly new to this site I would also like to apologize is any of the grammar is incorrect due to the fact that I used the voice command on my phone so I could make this go a little bit quicker

Wetting Upside down might be an interesting change of pace. I expect I will get my shirt wet. Perhaps I will try this. I have peed naked with my legs as far up the tub wall as I could I it splattered on my upper chest and chin.

As far as suggestions I just do everything I can until my pee comes out on its own. Lately I have been venturing outside rather than the tub or kitchen floor.

Laying upside down is nice
