I make him ask me permission to use the bathroom. and i love watching him struggle to hold it in. sometimes i even make him pay me for it and then i still say no.

He just looks so cute doing a dance and holding it in i cant help myself, i record it most of the times its like my own personal collection

That does sound hot tbf.

What type of guy is he? I only ask as if he's a masculine / macho / blokey bloke type, seeing him express his vulnerable side as he's frantically tries not to wet himself would be even more of a treat than if he was a bit softer in character and nerdier in appearance, like me for example. That might just be me judging people on their holding capabilities and likelihood of wetting themselves solely based on their appearance, though.
