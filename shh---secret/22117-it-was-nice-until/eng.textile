So I was hanging out with my friend the other day, and I just started a hold out of the blue. I was holding it for a couple of hours just relishing in the feel of a full bladder, then I finally decided to go to the bathroom. I was about to open the door, my bathroom is connected directly to my bedroom, when I decided to be a little naughty. I found some old swimsuit bottoms and put a few pads on them; put them on and went to go sit in front of my computer.

A few minutes later I went back to the bathroom and let out few spurts, the pads held pretty well, and I just decided to let go. It felt amazing sliding down my legs all warm and such. I had a bottle of windex in my room and I was just going to sop up the mess and spray that on the floor because I had already planned to clean the bathroom the next day. So I look down expecting to see a nice puddle collected at my feet, wrong. Apparently my bathroom floor is uneven and it all pooled behind my toilet; totally sucked to clean up. I think I'll stick with enjoying other's desperation and wetting. I hoped ya'll liked my story :)
