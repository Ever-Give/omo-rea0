Last night I was out late and came home after more alcohol than was good. I made sure to have some water before going to bed.

This morning I was dreaming about having to pee. I was desperate to go but couldn't find a bathroom. I thought I was going to wet myself. Then I suddenly woke up and I really really had to go.

I ran to the bathroom but my roommate was in it. I pounded on the door telling her to hurry up, it was an emergency.

She said she'd be out in a minute. I was holding myself and doing the potty dance. Then she flushed the toilet and that was it.

I started leaking in my panty. If I'd decided earlier I could have run to the kitchen and used a bowl, or found a towel or something, but it was too late. I was trying to hold it back but just as my roommate opened the bathroom door I lost it. The pee poured out of me, wetting my panty and legs and loudly hitting the floor in front of the bathroom.

My roommate stared at me and I stared at her. I didn't know what do say. "What...are...you...doing?" she asked.

"I really had to go," I said. Brilliant reply. But you try to come up with something better when you're half asleep, half naked, and standing in your own pee.
