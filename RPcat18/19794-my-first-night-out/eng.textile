Last November I turned 18 years old, which being from the UK meant I could finally go out for a drink. Now I am not a heavy drinker but I wanted to experience my local gay scene so when I was invited out to a run of the gay clubs in my area I couldn't refuse.

I hadn't ever had more than one drink in a night before that night so didn't really understand how badly drinking could make you need to pee. When I was on my third drink it started to hit me, I wasn't even drinking anything strong. However I wanted to hold it as I was talking to a pretty girl.

By the time I went I had already leaked a bit in my underwear and was a bit tipsy. I sat in the toilet and remember sighing loudly so everyone could hear me (not on purpose I was just enjoying my pee) and then when I carried on peeing longer than expected I said once again quite loudly "Wow it just keeps going doesn't it!" at this point I could hear folk giggling.

When I came out the stall, still pulling up my jeans as I went, with a big smile on my face I turned to another attractive girl I was out with that night and said "Wow I really was hydrated" sounding very impressed with myself for being able to pee so much.

That was my first time experiencing the effects of alcohol on the bladder what was yours like?
