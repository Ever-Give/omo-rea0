I haven't heard much from others on this area, or maybe I haven't searched well enough, but yea orgasm denial makes me need to sue the bathroom BADLY

Usually the longer it goes on the more it builds up, even after I finish I'll still have the need too. Sometimes I do it on purpose, but usually it comes with it. Does anyone else have that? And now I'm coming up with fun sinarios for written stuff for it
