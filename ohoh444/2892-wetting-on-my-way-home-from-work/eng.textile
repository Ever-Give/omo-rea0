Something unusual happened the other day. I peed my pants. I woke too late, so I did not have time to pee in the morning, I just rushed for the bus. I also forgot it the rest of the day since I was very busy.

Then the day was soon to come to an end and I still had to go alot. The toilets was at that time locked, but my shift was over so I went down to get to the bus, there is no more than a 10 minute walk. after 5 mins out in the cold I could really feel that now after almost a whole day, my bladder was so full. I decided to go pee in some bushes I was realized that else I would wet my self. I knew a truck parking spot near by, where I could do it without any one watching, as I walked across the parking lot to get to the corner with the bushes, I lost controll I couldent hold my self, I crossed my leggs and felt my bladder was loosing control. I ran for the spot, while I was already peeing. I just stood there and finished off, so I complitely soaked my pants and shoes.
