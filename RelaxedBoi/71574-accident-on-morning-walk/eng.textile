So I woke up one morning and got up, I hadn't gone to the bathroom yet but didn't have to go quite so much. I walked downstairs and got dressed I went out for a walk. A few hours later my bladder was in pain. As I kept walking a little trickled out of my Underpants and down my leg, I hid behind some trees where I was clenching myself. I held it in for so long but then more came spurting out until finally I couldn't hold it in any longer, it all gushed out onto my hands and onto my school clothes which I had so randomly put on in the morning. I was secretly in bliss! That's how I got into Omorashi and Omutsu.
