Hi everyone. I'm 27, I was born with Cerebral Palsy. I use a wheelchair, but I'm not paralyzed. I have full control of everything blow the waist. I know when I have to go, and I can hold it. But sometimes there wasn't an accessible bathroom, or it wasn't convenient for my parents to help me, and if I got extremely desperate they would tell me to "go ahead" and pee my pants.Has anyone else here ever been given permission to have an accident?
