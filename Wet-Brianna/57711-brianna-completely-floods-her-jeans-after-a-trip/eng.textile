I arrive home after a hiking trip bursting to pee. I guess I drank too much water during my hike. I think I can hold it long enough to prepare dinner for later on. I frantically search for cooking supplies up and down. I look at my phone for the recipe I need. After I take a few more steps the pressure on my bladder is too much, and I completely soak my jeans and my boots. I guess next time I will go to the restroom first!
