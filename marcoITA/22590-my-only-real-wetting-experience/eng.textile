Hi to everybody!

This is my only real, I mean un-intentionally, wtting experience....

This happened about 12 years ago... I was 20-21... however I've alwayse been attracted by pee play, and i don't know why that times I diden't pee under the shower...

So I was having a shower, and I don't remember why I didn't pee, so when I ended up to wash myself, I got out from the bathroom wearing the bathrobe and a full bladder... but not so full to be desperate to pee! just full!

I remember I went to my room to get some clothes to put on, and it was autumn, so the heating of my parent's house was still closed, so in the house was a bit cold... maybe for that reason or because of all the water I feel till that moment, it happened that all of a sudden, I felt a huge spurt of pee coming out from my penis and hit the bathrobe, making right away a big wet spot on the front of my bathrobe.

So I grabbed tight my dick and tightened my muscle to stop the flow, obviously it was not a big deal... so I took of the bathrobe coming back to the bathroom ad I sat on the toilet end peed the rest of my bladder into the toilet...

This is not so much.. .but this is real, I swear! that time I lose the control and peed myself a little involuntarily!

Hi...

Not so shocking since I'm into wetting and desperation... but actually I had never wetted myself accidentally till then, and neither after that episode.

However I noticed that when I have to pee really bad... sometimes I feel a little wetness around my penis... but I do think it is bound to the arousal that a full bladder gives me... since I do like desperate situation (but normally looking at desperate girl), being desperate myself turn me on, and I have a bone most of the time... so the wetness it is not pee but fluid from excitation... :)
