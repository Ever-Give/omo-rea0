First of all I have a tiny bladder and it was a complete accident and now I love omorashi I find it is so cute.

So what happened was I just came out of the shower I put on my white night dress and I went into my bed to sleep [of course] but then I started needing to go to the bathroom but my roommate was in the shower so I just decided to go to bed. Then at two in the morning I woke up feeling very cold so I got up walked into the living room to get another blanket and I walked past a mirror and I looked and, I saw my white night dress soaked. I started to freak out because this was the first time this has happened so I ran into my room with the blanket to check if I really wet the bed so I ran in and saw yes the sheets were soaked. I began to feel really dizzy because this was the first time it happened since I was 5 years old. Then I wrapped the blanket around we because I was freezing then out of nowhere I fainted. I woke up in the morning threw the sheets and the dress in the washer and no one ever found it out.
