So I'm a 30 year old female, never had a kid, don't do too much holding play right now due to a variety of reasons, never had bladder issues (except minor ones due to a medication I used to be on). But recently, I feel like I have bladder spasms and like I might leak far more often than I ever have before? And this past weekend I did leak.

Someone snuck up behind me and scared me and I leaked a little bit into my panties. Like to the point where I needed to change them.

I do drink a lot of water since I moved 2 years ago to a place that's much drier than where I used to be and since developing allergies. So I don't know if that's why? I'm wondering if it's because I've done a good bit of deliberate wettings so maybe my body is more relaxed about it but idk.
