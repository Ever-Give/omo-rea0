Doing an omo session while gaming is quite an experience.

It is very distracting making it far more difficult to concentrate. And when there is a lot of action in the game you kinda forget about your bladder (at least i did). But then as soon as the game calms down the feeling of the almost bursting bladder hits right back and much stronger than before
