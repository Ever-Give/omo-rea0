I work at a dealership as an auto tech.

Right now everything the building is closed to the public due to covid. I was pulling a car in through the gate today when a woman in her late 40s stopped me. Her car was being worked on in the body shop. She said "excuse me but my car is in being worked on but im in dire need of a washroom, do you know where one is around here?"

I had to explain to her that there was nothing around and we could not let anyone in the building due to covid.

She said "its just that i have no car to drive anywhere and im getting desperate" i tried asking management if she could come in but they said no.

She was pretty disappointed and did a little pee dance infront of me.

Later i saw her walking to the back lot. She mustve not been able to hold it and went behind the shed. I kind of felt bad for her.

Has anyone else had to refuse the bathroom to someone at work due to covid?
