I was at the food court and overheard a convo behind me about how two female friends said they now avoid using bathrooms in the mall because they dont want to touch the surfaces or wait in a poorly ventiliated area for a while. I doubt they had a fetish as they were just talking about it normally but I wonder if other women are like this now too and that means less line up for female restrooms?
