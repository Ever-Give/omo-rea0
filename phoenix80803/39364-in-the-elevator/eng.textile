In the Elevator

Hey guys,

So last week, I was going to my private lesson for clarinet. My teacher hosts the lessons in her apartment, and she lives on the third floor. So naturally, I have to take an elevator.

So I get in the elevator, I press three, and I wait.

It just so happened that I glanced down and saw a few drops of liquid on the floor, right in front of the console/button panel thingy. It didn't look like much, maybe five drops here, and then a couple more drops in the corner. So I knelt down and I stuck a finger in it. It was cold, but the volume of liquid and the placement made me think it was a leaking of pee. And there's only one way to find out.

I lifted that finger to my tongue.

My suspicions were confirmed. It was salty, and slightly sweet. The placement and volume also made me think that it was a woman wearing a dress or, -heavens forbid!- going commando under said dress.

I immediately got a hard-on, just as I got to my floor...

BTW: the liquid was still mostly there on the ride down.
