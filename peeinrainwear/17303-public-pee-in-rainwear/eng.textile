My first time publicly peeing was a cold winther night on my way back from the supermarket. I had put on a pair of jeans under my shiny green rain pants. Since the weather was nice this day I put a pair of sweat pants over the rain pants.

I had filled up my bladder to the point of explosion before I went out. Sertain that I would not make it bake home without having to pee in public.

As I walked towards the supermarked located approximately 1 km from my home i felt the urge to emty my bladder. It was cold and the rainpant was getting stiff by the coldness. I managed to hold the urge to pee and entered the supermaked.

Nervously i walked between the shelves not knowing if anybody noticed the rainpants underneath my sweat pants. When I got the counter and waited in line I let a huge spurt of pee let out. soaking my jeans all the way down to my shoes. I stopped just in time so that no pee dripped to the floor.

The warm pee softened the rainpants and made the jeans stick nice and thightly to my legs. On the way back I took a small detour and let the rest of my spurt out of me as i walked. the hot steaming piss gushed out of the bottom of my pants and soaked my sneakers and bottom part of the sweat pants. Since it was now qiute dark outside i was convinced thath noboby would notice the wetness as I walked home.

As the days went by this became a weakly rutine on my way to the store;)
