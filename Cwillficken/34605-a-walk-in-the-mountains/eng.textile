This was my first experience losing control of my bladder as a teen, I guess in a way this was the beginning...

When I was 17 I went with my class to a trip in the mountains, I'm not a fan of hiking so the long hike up hill made me drink a lot of fluids, I noticed on the way up that there were some bathrooms on the side of the trail but I never stopped to pee... that day I only went to the bathroom once in the morning and with the amount of fluids that I'd been drinking on the way up my bladder was starting to feel really full by the early afternoon when we were finally on the way back down the mountain.. I really needed to pee so I was on the look out for a bathroom, and I was talking to my friend to get distracted of the feeling that I really had to go. 

I was so focused on that that I didn't notice the moment I lost control of it, I just notice something warm going thru my leg and I notice how my pant got wet and thats when I realize what was actually happening, I was peeing myself in the middle of the trail and the flow just wouldn't stop, it felt like I peed for hours, and all I remember is telling my friend I think I'm peeing myself and she watched the whole thing happening, she was my only witness since everyone else was behind us (I was going really fast in my search for a bathroom) and by the time we got back to the bus she told everyone that she spilled her soda on my pants and sat by me on the drive back home...

As I said, that was my first experience and saw it fit for it to be my first story, I hope you enjoyed it.
