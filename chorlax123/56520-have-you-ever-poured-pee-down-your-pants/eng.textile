Have you ever poured pee down your pants?

Has anyone ever peed into a bottle, glass, or pitcher, and then poured the pee down their pants?

I have difficulty wetting myself with pants on, often taking 30-45min to let out spurts that would otherwise be a 1 minute pee. Even after I go, I find I still have more to pee once I pull my pants down.

I've seen a few videos where people have done similar. One time a guy attached surgical tubing to a bottle filled with pee, then shoved the other end down a pair of snowbibs. It looked like he was peeing forever with a steady stream and I was super jealous. Then the bottle fell down and I saw he was 'faking' it, although it looked like really pee in the bottle.

Anyways, sounds like something fun to try...

Like I said, I have difficulty going when my pants are pulled up. I suppose I'm "trained" too well.
